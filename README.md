# Pyber_Analysis

### Project Overview
Hello Mr. Isualize, this project as per your request was to create a summary dataframe of ride-sharing data by city types. From there we constructed a multiple line graph in an effort better visualize the total fares by city type.

### Results of Analysis
As is to be expected, the data for total rides and total drivers shows that amount of drivers and rides increases considerably with closer proximity to urban centers. Urban cities also had the most total fares as well, however, rural cities led all city types with the highest average fare at an average of $34.62 per ride.

### Conclusion
Considering the results of the aforementioned analysis, there are a few conclusions we can reach that may help to increase revenue. First, increasing the number of drivers present in non-urban areas, namely cities in rural areas. Considering that customers are willing to pay at a higher rate, further expansion should generate more income. Another possibility would be to increase the average fare per ride in urban cities. Due to the much higher volume of PyBer utilization in urban cities, even a marginal increase in fares should produce a sizeable return. These adjustments should serve to help the company thrive in todays market.
